# beginner java projects

this is simply a collection of extremely-beginner-friendly java projects for learning the absolute basics of java. And the projects don't get harder than something like leetcode easy, maybe a leetcode medium.
The best way to use this resource is to go through, look through the code, comprehend it, and then go and write your own version of the code.
I plan on releasing a collection of larger projects in multiple languages, I will link that here if/when I eventually release that project.
*to go without saying, this project is obviously best used with other resources, such as documentation.*

other resources:
-

*CodeHS Sandbox (Java)* gives free, and easy to understand documentation that is extremely helpful for anyone learning Java.

*Java documentation* is another great resource for more advanced users working on more complex projects, but still can be useful for beginners.
